    Setting things up:

        Be sure to create a folder where everything from the site will go.

        The main or home page of a website needs to be named "index.html"
            The server will automatically look for this name.

    What is HTML & CSS

        HTML - Hypertext Markup Language
            - A markup language that determines what information is presented on a web page.

        CSS - Cascading Style Sheet
            - Where style and presentation of web page is changed.
            - A seperate layer around HTML content.

    How to Create Your First Page

        The following elements are in every page:
 -->

<!DOCTYPE html> <!-- This specifies to the browser that we are using HTML5 -->
    
<html lang="en">   <!-- The html element starts here, lang attribute specifies language-->
  
<head> <!-- Provides browser with information about the site -->
    
    <meta charset="UTF-8">  <!-- Tells the browser what character type we are using -->
       
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
        <!-- Allows website to be resposive, making sure things are scaled correctly
        Tells the browser we want to manipulate the viewport so that the content is prsented in a 1:1 scale with the device being used-->


    <title>Document</title> <!--  Text displayed on browser tab -->
    
</head>
<body>
    
    <!-- The body tag contains everything visible on a page -->
    
</body>
</html>
