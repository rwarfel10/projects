    #3: How to Structure an HTML File
    -----------------------------------

    HTML Element - Basic building block that forms structure of HTML
                 - Starts with opening tag and ends with closing tag (normally) 
                 - Exceptions to this include meta and link tags among others
                
    HTML Attribute - Provides further detail for element when necessary.
                   - Elements may not need additional attributes
    
    
    *Generally* anything visible on web page will be structured as a system of boxes (boxes within boxes)
